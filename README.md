The data included in the "Breast Cancer.csv" contains information of breast cancer patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Institute of Cancer (2017).  The data involved female patients with inltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer diagnosed in 2006-2010. In total, there are 4024 samples, with 85% pertaining to the Alive class. The dataset contains the  following variables, where variables 1-14 correspond to the features and variables 15-16 correspond to the outcomes. 

In addtion to some data exploration, I implement a K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to determine the patient's status (alive/dead).
